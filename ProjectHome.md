Yet another rewrite of the now hackneyed web proxy. Nothing special not better nor less than the other many web proxies around. It's different.

Needs lot of cleanup. Also a few files are shared between this and Project Mugatiya, but they may be out of synch now.

The only advantages are that this has a content filter and has the ability to be 'rented' out. This means that by modifying the calling url you can change the color and the addpage that appears in the proxy. This hasn't been tested in ages so probably wont work.
